# Filecoin-Plus-Pathway
The FileDrive Data Preparer Pathway is one of several DataCap allocation pathways within the Filecoin ecosystem.

In this pathway, data preparers take on the role of primary applicants for the DC (DataCap) application. 
We believe that data preparers possess a deeper understanding of the Filecoin network and FIL+, enabling them to assist data storage clients in efficiently onboarding valuable data onto the Filecoin network.  With their specialized tools and solutions for data preprocessing, data preparers play a crucial role in streamlining the data storage process.
