Contact:Â jieme_zhang@yahoo.com


## Client Scope
Any client looking to onboard a Public Dataset to Filecoin can apply to this allocator pathway.

## Client requirements:
- At least 4 sealed copies of a dataset, stored with 4 separate Storage Provider entities, at least in 2 different regional locations(city).
- The dataset is made readily retrievable on the network. And the retrieval rate should not be less than 75%.
- Clients disclose their storage provider partners upfront. VPN for storage provider is not allowed.


## Client Diligence 
We maintain a rigorous, multi-stage verification protocol to ensure only qualified entities participate in our program. The onboarding process includes submission of legal formation documents, independent validation of all provided information, and structured client interviews to assess legitimacy. Clients must commit to maintaining high data retrieval performance, distributing deals equitably across storage providers in multiple regions, and collaborating with us exclusively. All processes and associated materials will be posted on GitHub for FIL+ and community review.

## Data Diligence 
We maintain program integrity through a comprehensive diligence process to ensure that all data and clients adhere to program guidelines and fully comply with applicable local and regional regulations. Clients must provide detailed documentation of data preparation methodologies and dataset characteristics (including type and volume). We conduct regular verification procedures, including random data ownership audits (content sampling), deal data validation (mapping file analysis), and Payload CID cross-verification using Filecoin tools. We provide complete audit documentation to ensure transparency and traceability, encompassing client-submitted materials, confirmed compliance agreements, representative mapping file samples, comprehensive verification logs, and monitoring outcomes.

## How to Get DataCap
Client can get the DataCaps on the (https://github.com/filedrive-team/Filecoin-Plus-Pathway/issues) to initialize an new issue.

### Allocation Schedule
- First allocation max 5%, but no more than 256TiB; 
- Second max 10%; 
- Third max 15%; 
- Fourth max 20%; 
- Fifth and there after max 25%;
AND No allocation can be bigger than 2x of the previous one. 



## Subsequent allocation schedule:
When clients use up > 75% of the prior DataCap allocation, a request for additional DataCap in the form of the next tranche is automatically kicked off (via the subsequent allocation bot). 



## Disputes Handling
Disputes in the pathway would be submitted and tracked through a public Google document to ensure open and transparent communication among all stakeholders. Each case would be promptly reviewed, with issues assessed and urgency set within 48 hours. All status updates, discussions, and rationales would be documented openly in the Google doc, allowing both submitters and the community to monitor the process in real time. For more complex or unresolved cases, a senior member of the organization would conduct an in-depth investigation and provide a resolution within 10 days, with all outcomes and reasoning made public and anonymized. If a dispute remains unsettled after these steps, the Fil+ governance body would step in to review and issue a final decision, ensuring maximum accountability and transparency.
